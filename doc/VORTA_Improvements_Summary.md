- Defer complex features (neuromorphic, RDMA) to v2.0+
- Shorter path to market validation

### **Pragmatic Architecture**

```
Simple Stack:
├── FastAPI (proven, rapid development)
├── Kubernetes (industry standard)
├── FAISS (battle-tested vector search)
├── Redis (reliable caching)
└── Prometheus/Grafana (standard monitoring)
```

## 💰 Financial Realism

### **Conservative Unit Economics**

- **CAC:** €15K-25K (realistic for enterprise)
- **LTV:** €180K-300K (based on industry benchmarks)
